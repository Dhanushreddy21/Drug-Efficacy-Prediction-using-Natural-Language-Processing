# Drug-Efficacy-Prediction-using-Natural-Language-Processing

Completed this project as part of my Avance Data Science Project with United Network of Professionals (UNP). Key highlights:

Studied and Analyzed the Drug efficacy Prediction dataset to applying Natural Language Processing Algorithm and present my insights. Performed various project stages linke data pre-processing,data representation,architecture selection and training and evolution to understand the data and compare the variables. Experimented with different Machine Learning algorithms, Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Bagging, and Boosting. Compared the results to recommend the best Machine Learning model.
